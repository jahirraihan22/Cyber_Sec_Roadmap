### CIA Triad  

-  **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users and processes should be able to access or modify data  
-  **Integrity:** Data should be maintained in a correct state and nobody should be able to improperly modify it, either accidentally or maliciously  
-  **Availability:** Authorized users should be able to access data whenever they need

### AAA

- **Authentication:** Authentication is used to verify the identity of a person
- **Authorization:** Authorization is used to verify the persons has the correct permissions to access something
- **Accounting:** Accounting involves recording the persons access, by logging their activities.

> AAA are important principles in Cyber Security as they allow control over access to assets like information, thereby protecting it. The right people (as well as other systems) will only be able to access this information is they have been given permission to do so.

#### What is the difference between authentication, authorization and accounting?

> Authentication involves checking the identity being used is being used by the correct owner of the identity. Authorization checks what the identity has permissions (access rights) to and Accounting records what the identity does.

### Vulnerability 

> A vulnerability in cyber security refers to any weakness in an information system, system processes, or internal controls of an organization. These vulnerabilities are targets for lurking cybercrimes and are open to exploitation through the points of vulnerability.


	
#### To protect asset from vulnerability need to
- Firewall
- Manage latest anti virus
- Control other security  


### Mitigation

> Cybersecurity risk mitigation involves the use of security policies and processes to reduce the overall risk or impact of a cybersecurity threat. In regard to cybersecurity, risk mitigation can be separated into three elements: prevention, detection, and remediation.


### Threat actor

> In cybersecurity, this 'enemy' is called the threat actor. We can define a threat actor as person, group, or entity that creates all or part of an incident with the aim to impact an organization’s security. **For an Example Malware is threat And who spread malware called threat actor**


### Defense of depth

> Defense in depth is a cybersecurity approach that involves protecting your environment under several layers of security protocols, rather than relying on a single protective measure. This method yields greater protective force against attacks because you have redundant safeguards throughout your environment or even on a single device—like posting sentries at each door throughout a home, rather than only at the front door. Because no single security measure can block all attacks, defense in depth is a way to thwart attacks that get past your initial security measures.
